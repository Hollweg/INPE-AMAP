#INPE Sattelite Data Manipulation

##The purpose

This software was developed during my period as a **fellow student in INPE (2014-2015), in the middle of my Electrical Engineering bachelor.** 

The software was developed to INPE (National Institute for Space Research).</br>
It main idea was **manipulate data from GPS sattelites and GPS stations**, making easy the insertion of data in different statystical softwares, like SGEMs. </br>

As the raw data provenient by observation source in most cases contains a large quantity of data (100MB+) it is unable to manipulate data manually. </br> 

In this way it was developed this algorithm to make easy the .txt files insertion in different softwares, allowing corrupt elements filtering, like wrong data read or errors during acquisition data. 

##Utilization

The algorithm allows user to choose a data source (GPS stations or GPS sattelites) and how it is desired to be the output.txt file. 

In addition, for the software right functioning it is needed that in the same folder that contains the .c file exist a folder called _InFiles/_ with all brute data to be filtered.

The software has a simple graphic interface, allowing user to select the right option according it objective.

The algorithm makes it easy data insertion in 2 different software used in INPE: 

1. SGEMS (http://sgems.sourceforge.net/?q=node/77) </br>
2. Octave (https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/)
